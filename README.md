# todo-backend

This is the backend of a todo list app I worked on to learn how to seperate the backend from the frontend.

It is built in Node, express and MongoDB

This is an api that uses the GET, POST, PUT and DELETE methods to add items to a database with the intention to call them on the front end of the app
